Botfaqs is a Discord chatbot that helps manage FAQ questions for channels in a Discord server. We collect and use the following personal information from users: Discord username and server ID, user ID, message ID, channel ID, and the number of likes a FAQ gets. This information is used to provide the service, track the popularity of FAQs, and for analytics and research purposes. Please note that we only use user IDs and usernames temporarily when creating or modifying FAQs, and do not store them. We retain the other personal information for as long as you use the chatbot. We take reasonable measures to protect users' personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Users have the right to access, correct, or delete their personal information.
